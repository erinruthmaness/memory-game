# Personal Notes:

Although I've worked with React a lot in classes and in my professional life, as someone whose interests skew toward the front end, I've been lucky enough to rarely be the person responsible for running it.  The hardest work I usually do in Bash for a React app is running the initial create-react-app script and naming the folder - if that!  Reviewing how to actually set up an entire project and deploy it to github took me longer than I'm happy to admit!  I am, however, very glad to have completed that portion of the exercise, as this has been the biggest stumbling block preventing me from pursuing a few personal projects I've been interested in making recently.

I also spent a pretty inexcusable amount of time trying to figure out how to store the emojis as their decimal codes, hex codes, and a few other things before I finally figured out how to pass them through the components as variables and then parse them through JSX.  Once I had the idea to use them, I got a little bit stubborn about wanting to figure out how to make it work!  The final thing that tripped me up was mobile-responsiveness.  I'm always torn between using flexboxes (which feel easy) or branching out into assigning widths and floating items left, then centerting with auto margins, or branching out into the relatively unknown world of grids.  For this project, I decided to use grids and assign fixed widths to the cards (so that the size of the image would be more precise) and I think this worked well.  I had a lot of fun with style and color, which is probably obvious.

I'd like to come back to this project (probably later today, knowing me) to add instructions on intitial load, and maybe a little "help" icon in the top corner that can bring them back at any time.
